### passwordGeneratorMM

## Overview

Upon review of this project, the reader will find a functioning password generator equipped with prompts that ask for the exact type of password the user wants. The user can specify how long the password will be, the type of characters included in the password, and whether they would like uppercase or lowercase letters. The code includes clear comments explaining what the different functions do and how they coexist to make the generator run.
